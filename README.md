###Perl-things!
Yet another creatively named repo!
It's a roguelike written to help get me better acquainted with perl.
It uses Curses for output but could be configured to use something else. 
####Features of note
A random name generator that uses Markov Chains
of digrams and trigrams.
Extensible map and object system with a couple options for generation.
Fancy curses graphics!
